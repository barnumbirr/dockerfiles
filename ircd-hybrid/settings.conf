# This file contains many run-time configurable options
# for Hybserv services.
#
# The format for this file is as follows:
#
# Directive Parameter1 Parameter2 ...
#
# Directive is the name of some feature or variable,
# and the parameters are values you wish to specify
# for it. The directive is case-insensitive.
#
# If you wish to specify a string as a parameter, you
# may enclose it with quotation marks. This is especially
# a good idea if the string has spaces in it:
#
# "Parameter string with spaces"
# "Parameter string with \"double quotes\" in it"
#
# Time parameters may be specified as one integer,
# representing the number of seconds ("3600" = 1 hour),
# or as a combination of integers and unit specifiers:
#  "w" = weeks
#  "d" = days
#  "h" = hours
#  "m" = minutes
#  "s" = seconds
# Examples:
#  "1h30m"     = 1 hour 30 minutes
#  "2d"        = 2 days
#  "5w1d10m5s" = 5 weeks 1 day 10 minutes 5 seconds
#
# Each directive is thoroughly documented, and should contain
# one of the following to let you know if an option is
# required:
#
# [REQUIRED]
#   Indicates a required directive. Without it, services will
#   not start.
#
# [RECOMMENDED]
#   Indicates a strongly recommended directive, but omitting it
#   will not affect the starting or running of services.
#   Recommended options can typically be disabled by setting
#   them to 0 (if they have a value associated with them), or
#   commenting them out.
#
# [OPTIONAL]
#   Indicates an optional directive. It is entirely up to you
#   whether to include it or not. In most cases, commenting
#   out the directive will disable the feature. If this is
#   not the case, it will be explained in detail.
#
# [NOT RECOMMENDED]
#   Indicates a directive which may cause ill effects if
#   used. More information would be included in it's
#   documentation.

# Services Security Settings
#
################################################################

# SecureMessaging [OPTIONAL]
#
#  Enabling this will force users to message services via
# theoretically more secure way - directly with hostmask.
# For example: /msg Nickserv@services.com

#SecureMessaging

# RestrictedAccess [OPTIONAL]
#
#  Enabling this will prevent everyone from using services,
# except those listed in hybserv.conf with at least "o"
# privileges.

#RestrictedAccess

# AutoOpAdmins [OPTIONAL]
#
# If EMPOWERADMINS is defined:
#   * If AutoOpAdmins is enabled admins will have the same level of
#    access as a channel founder, and will thus be autoopped on
#    joining.
#   * If AutoOpAdmins is disabled they'll have no special access to a
#    channel, autoopping will be dependant on the access list.
#
# If EMPOWERADMINS_MORE is defined:
#   All admins have the power of founder in all registered channels.
#   SET RESTRICTED does not apply to admins.
#
#   * If AutoOpAdmins is enabled admins will be opped on joining any
#    channel registered with ChanServ.
#   * If AutoOpAdmins is disabled admins will not have AUTOOP,
#    AUTOVOICE or AUTOHALFOP on any channel granted to them by virtue
#    of being an admin - the access list will decide if they'll be
#    opped.

AutoOpAdmins

# OpersHaveAccess [OPTIONAL]
#
#  Enable this to allow any global operator to access OperServ.
# Any operator (who doesn't have an O: line in hybserv.conf)
# will be given the equivalent of an "o", "j", and "g" flag,
# but they will not be given partyline access. It is disabled
# by default because I do not like the idea of just any
# operator to be able to access OperServ.

#OpersHaveAccess

# SmartMasking [OPTIONAL]
#
#  Without this option, NickServ will use almost all of
# the segments of your hostname to use for your hostmask,
# when you enable SET AUTOMASK. This means that if you
# have a very long hostname because of your isp, or
# even if you have a second TLD (such as xx.xx.xx.isp.com.au),
# your automask will be very specific: (ie: *.xx.xx.isp.com.au).
#  However, with this option enabled, services will attempt
# to compensate for this by detecting how long your hostname
# is. If it detects a very long hostname, it will use only
# the last 3 segments of your hostname for your hostmask.
#
#  For example, if you come from the host:
#
#     My.ISP.likes.to.have.very.long.hosts.com
#
# your hostmask would be: *.long.hosts.com with this
# option enabled, rather than *.likes.to.have.very.long.hosts.com.

# AutoKillClones [NOT RECOMMENDED]
#
#  Enable this to auto-kill clones if they exceed a value

MaxChannel         15

# MaxKill <value> [REQUIRED]
#
#  Set this to the maximum number of kills to allow KILLHOST or
# TRACE -k to perform - to prevent huge mass kills.

MaxKill            5

# LimitTraceKills [OPTIONAL]
#
#  Enable this to disable the combination "TRACE -nolimit -kill".
# Normally, -nolimit -kill ignores the MaxKill limit but this
# option helps to avoid catastrophes.

#LimitTraceKills

# ServerNotices [OPTIONAL]
#
#  Enable this to have the actual server name send notices to
# clients instead of the service bot nicknames.

#ServerNotices

# DoWallops [OPTIONAL]
#
#  Enable this to have services send a server wallops when an oper
# executes one of the following commands:
#  rehash, restart, die, kill, jupe, unjupe, gline, ungline,
#  omode, secure, on, off, jump, killchan, killhost, htm

#DoWallops

# BCFloodCount [RECOMMENDED]
# BCFloodTime  [RECOMMENDED]
#
#  Enable these options to have OperServ halt partyline broadcasts
# if BCFloodCount lines are sent to the partyline within BCFloodTime.
# This feature is mainly directed towards large netjoins or netsplits
# where partyline users may not wish to see all the clients and
# servers connecting/splitting.
# I have noticed most weird behaviour of this option on large networks,
# therefore it should be disabled by default. I've also increased

# feature will require a bit of memory on a fairly large
# network.

LastSeenInfo

# NicknameWarn [OPTIONAL]
#
#  Enable this to give a warning to new users to identify
# with their password in order to access more commands.
# Nicknames that have kill protection will be warned
# regardless of this option being enabled.

NicknameWarn

# NSReleaseTimeout <time> [OPTIONAL]
#
#  Set this to the amount of time to wait before releasing
# a nickname enforcer after a nick collide. If you disable
# this, nicknames will never be released.

NSReleaseTimeout   "5m"

# NickRegDelay <time> [RECOMMENDED]
#
#  Set this to the amount of time to wait between successive
# uses of the register command. This prevents malicious users
# coming on your network and registering a ton of nicknames.

NickRegDelay       "30s"

# MaxLinks <value> [RECOMMENDED (if Linked Nicknames enabled)]
#
#  Maximum number of nicknames that can be in one link. Only
# effective if LINKED_NICKNAMES is defined in config.h.

MaxLinks           20

# AllowKillProtection [OPTIONAL]

# disabled, they may still use /msg nickserv ghost/recover

AllowKillProtection

# AllowKillImmed [OPTIONAL]
#
#  Enable this to allow users to SET KILL IMMED for their

#
#  Set this to the amount of time ChanServ will stay in
# an empty channel (after the last user leaves).

InhabitTimeout     "5m"

# AllowAccessIfSOp [OPTIONAL]
#
#  Enable this so ChanServ won't deop anyone on a channel
# as long as there is a SuperOp or higher opped on the
# channel. This option only works when services first
# connects to the network, so it won't deop entire channels
# (since no-one has identified yet). If this feature
# is enabled, and there is no SuperOp on the channel,
# every non-autoop will be deoped.
#  Disabling this feature will cause ChanServ to deop
# every non-autoop on the channel after a netjoin.

AllowAccessIfSOp

# RestrictRegister [OPTIONAL]
#
#  Enabling this option will prevent normal users from
# registering new channels. Only services operators
# and administrators will be allowed to use the register
# command. Normal users will still be allowed to enter
# registered channels and execute commands on channels
# they have access to.

#RestrictRegister

# NotifyOpers [OPTIONAL]
#
#  Enabling this will cause NickServ to notify registered
# Service operators to be notified when someone is doing
# INFO on them. Normally not necessary.

#NotifyOpers

# GiveNotice [OPTIONAL]
#
#  Enabling this will cause ChanServ to send a notice to
# users when they are deopped to explain why. For example,
# if a channel has SECURE set, ChanServ will notice all
# users it deops that the channel is secured.

GiveNotice

# AllowGuardChannel [OPTIONAL]
#
# Enabling this will ignore CS_GUARD option for any channel,
# so Chanserv will not sit on any channel. I have found this
# quite annoying feature, so this is how you can turn if off.

AllowGuardChannel

# MinNickAge <time> [OPTIONAL]

# LagDetect [OPTIONAL]
#
#  Enable this to have StatServ perform server pings every
# minute in order to compile a list of ping replies from
# all servers. This can help determine which servers are
# badly lagged. Of course, the information could be deceiving
# if services itself is lagged.
#  The ping reply information can be obtained on an individual
# server basis by using StatServ's "SERVER" command.
#
# NOTE: If you are on a *very* large network, you may not
#       want StatServ pinging all servers every minute, unless
#       of course you have an obscene amount of bandwidth :-).

#LagDetect

# MaxPing <time> [OPTIONAL]
#
#  Set this to the maximum ping time services should accept
# from it's current hub server. If the ping reply from the hub
# is greater than this value, services will assume the lag
# is too great, and will attempt to switch hubs. Of course,
# if there is only one S: line in hybserv.conf, this option
# will have no effect.
#  Generally, it is a good idea to try and keep services as
# "lag-free" as possible, so it can properly handle nickname
# and channel issues quickly. This feature makes it easier
# to keep a decent route to the network.
#  This feature has no effect unless "LagDetect" (above) is

# For example, a value of 3 means *.net will work, but

# 2 - Same as level 1, but log server events (kills, squits etc),
#     as well. Also, log all commands sent to Service Bots.
#
# 3 - Same as level 2, but log all channel activity as well
#     (modes/kicks).
#     NOTE: Level 3 will cause your log file to be huge if you
#     are on a fairly big net.  It was mainly implemented
#     to debug, but is available for those who wish to
#     keep track of who's doing what in channels.

# MaxLogs <value> [RECOMMENDED]
#
#  Set this to the maximum number of log files you want
# to keep. At midnight every day, the log file will be
# renamed to something like: hybserv.log.YYYYMMDD, and
# a new log file will be started. After the number of log
# files has reached MaxLogs, the oldest log file will be
# deleted to make room for the new one.
#  You may comment this out to never delete log files -- that

# MaxModes <value> [REQUIRED]
#
#  Set this to the maximum number of modes your ircd can
